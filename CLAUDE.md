# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a comprehensive lambda calculus research repository focused on building production-ready implementations with world-class academic foundations. The repository contains:

**CORE STRENGTHS:**
- 31 numbered categories with 700+ citations (world-class academic organization)
- Implementations catalog referencing external projects (not in-repo TAPL tree)
- Modern documentation infrastructure with MkDocs
- Automated validation and quality assurance systems
- Comprehensive cross-reference system and bibliography management

**CURRENT FOCUS:**
- Using external TAPL Rust implementations as references
- Progressive development: Untyped λ-calculus → Simply Typed → System F → Dependent Types
- Academic rigor with practical implementation emphasis
- Quality over quantity: deep implementation rather than superficial coverage

## Repository Structure

### Primary Implementation Core
- External implementations guide development; see Implementations Catalog in docs

### Academic Reference Structure (01-31)
The numbered directories provide comprehensive academic foundations:
- **01-XX-name/** - Academic organization: `papers/`, `implementations/`, `tutorials/`, `historical/`
- **Current State**: Excellent bibliographies (700+ citations), minimal in-repo implementations
- **Strategy**: Use as reference while building implementations in `sources/`

### Supporting Infrastructure
- **`papers-archive/`** - Academic paper collection with download automation
- **`implementations/`** - Multi-language research implementations (secondary to Rust core)
- **Root Documentation** - Cross-references, bibliographies, comprehensive indices
- **Build System** - Unified Makefile targeting actual implementations

### Key Files
- External Rust implementations: see referenced repositories in the catalog
- **`Makefile`** - Master build system (updated for actual implementations)
- **`validate-repository.py`** - Quality assurance and validation
- **`mkdocs-simplified.yml`** - Documentation generation
- **`COMPREHENSIVE_INDEX.md`** - Academic reference index

## Build Systems and Development

### PRIORITY BUILD SYSTEM: External Rust TAPL Implementations (reference)

Use the external repos’ own instructions to build and test.

### Essential Commands

#### Repository Health & Quality Assurance
```bash
# ALWAYS RUN THESE FIRST
./validate-repository.py                 # Full validation of structure and links
./standardize_bibliography.py           # Bibliography consistency check
make status                             # Repository health status
make verify                            # Academic integrity verification
```

#### Core Development Workflow
```bash
# Primary development cycle (follow external repos when working with code)

# Documentation development
source venv/bin/activate               # ALWAYS activate before docs work
mkdocs serve --config-file mkdocs-simplified.yml  # Live server (127.0.0.1:8000)
mkdocs build --config-file mkdocs-simplified.yml  # Production build

# Master build system (targets available implementations)
make build                             # Build available implementations + docs
make test                              # Run all available tests
make clean                             # Clean all build artifacts
make ci                               # Full CI pipeline
```

#### Supporting Language Targets (Secondary)
```bash
# Multi-language implementations (when they exist)
make build-scala                       # Build Scala implementations (if any)
make build-haskell                     # Build Haskell implementations (if any)
make build-idris                       # Build Idris implementations (if any)

# Academic source repositories (reference only)
cd sources/agda-src/ && make install   # Agda compiler source
cd sources/coq-src/ && make world      # Coq/Rocq theorem prover source
```

#### Paper Archive Management
```bash
cd papers-archive/
make download-high                  # Download high-priority papers
make search QUERY="linear logic"    # Search papers by topic
make verify                         # Verify URL accessibility
make status                         # Get repository status
```

## Code Architecture

### PRODUCTION-READY RESEARCH PLATFORM

This repository balances academic rigor with production-quality implementations:

1. **Implementation-First**: Working code drives theoretical understanding
2. **Academic Foundation**: 708+ papers provide comprehensive theoretical backing
3. **Quality Focus**: Deep implementation of core concepts vs shallow coverage of everything
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Build understanding through working implementations

### RUST-CENTERED ARCHITECTURE (REFERENCE)

**IMPLEMENTATION THEMES** (via external repos):
- **Type-Safe Design**: Rust's type system enforces correctness
- **Performance Focus**: Zero-cost abstractions for lambda calculus operations
- **Memory Safety**: Deterministic performance
- **Academic Validation**: Algorithms reference original papers (TAPL, Pierce)

**IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS:**
```rust
// Type-safe lambda calculus representations
pub enum Term {
    Var(String),
    Abs(String, Box<Term>),
    App(Box<Term>, Box<Term>),
}

// Context-aware type checking
pub fn typecheck(ctx: &Context, term: &Term) -> Result<Type, TypeError>

// Capture-avoiding substitution
pub fn substitute(term: Term, var: &str, replacement: Term) -> Term
```

### SUPPORTING MULTI-LANGUAGE ECOSYSTEM
- **Haskell**: Academic prototyping and research validation
- **OCaml**: Formal verification links (Coq integration)
- **Scala**: JVM-based implementations for industry integration
- **Academic Sources**: Agda/Coq for formal proofs and verification

## Development Workflow

### PRIORITY: Extending Core Implementations (externally)

**IMPLEMENTATION-FIRST APPROACH:**
1. **Start in Rust**: Contribute to external TAPL-style implementations
2. **Build Core Functionality**: Focus on working, tested, documented code
3. **Academic Integration**: Reference papers, add to bibliography after implementation
4. **Quality Gate**: `cargo test && cargo fmt && cargo clippy` before any commit

**NEW VARIANT DEVELOPMENT:**
```bash
# 1. Implement in Rust first
# Implement, test, document (in external repos)

# 2. Update academic structure
mkdir 32-new-variant/
cd 32-new-variant/ && mkdir papers implementations tutorials historical
# Add bibliography.md with academic references

# 3. Cross-reference integration
./validate-repository.py    # Ensure quality
./standardize_bibliography.py    # Bibliography consistency
```

### REALISTIC BIBLIOGRAPHY MANAGEMENT
- **Implementation-Driven**: Add papers as you implement concepts
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on foundational papers, not everything ever written
- **Academic Standards**: Author, year, title, venue, DOI when available
- **Regular Validation**: `./validate-repository.py` catches broken links and inconsistencies

### IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS (ENFORCED)

// Example: Beta reduction performance requirement
#[cfg(test)]
mod performance_tests {
    #[test]
    fn test_beta_reduction_performance() {
        let large_term = generate_large_term(1000);
        let start = std::time::Instant::now();
        let result = beta_reduce(large_term);
        let duration = start.elapsed();
        assert!(duration < std::time::Duration::from_millis(100));
    }
}
```

### DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS
- **Comprehensive**: Every public function documented with examples
- **Mathematical Notation**: MathJax for complex formulas
- **Educational Links**: Connect theory to implementation
- **Working Examples**: All code examples must compile and run
