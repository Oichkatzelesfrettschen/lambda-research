# Foundational Papers on Directed Type Theory

This bibliography lists key papers that introduced and developed Directed Type Theory, focusing on its asymmetric approach to transformations and its connections to higher category theory.

## Key Papers

*   **Sterling, J., & Harper, R. (2020). *2-Dimensional Directed Type Theory*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This foundational work introduces 2DTT, a type theory where higher-dimensional structure is explicit at the judgmental level. It provides a synthetic framework for reasoning about higher categories and explicitly accounts for variances of families of types.

*   **North, P. (2018). *Towards a Directed Homotopy Type Theory*. (arXiv:1807.10566)**
    *   **Contribution:** This paper introduces a "homomorphism" type former within Martin-Löf type theory, designed to capture the concepts of morphisms from category theory and directed paths from directed homotopy theory, in contrast to the identity type former.

*   **Altenkirch, T., & Neumann, J. (2021). *Synthetic 1-Categories in Directed Type Theory*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This paper proposes a structured approach using Generalized Algebraic Theories (GATs) and introduces Directed Categories with Families (DCwFs) with a modal typing discipline to handle variances across contexts, providing a way to formalize synthetic category theory.

*   **Gratzer, D. (2021). *Bicubical Directed Type Theory*. (Doctoral dissertation)**
    *   **Contribution:** This dissertation provides a constructive model of directed type theory, including directed univalence, using bicubical sets, offering a concrete foundation for implementing DTT.

*   **Laretto, A. (2022). *Di- is for Directed: First-Order Directed Type Theory via Dinaturality*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This work introduces a first-order directed type theory where types are semantically interpreted as categories and terms as functors, featuring an elimination principle for directed equality motivated by dinaturality.

*   **Neumann, J. (2022). *Polarized and Directed Type Theory*.**
    *   **Contribution:** Further elaborates on the homomorphism type and its associated J-rule, highlighting how it differs from the standard identity type in Martin-Löf Type Theory and its implications for directed reasoning.
