# Foundational Papers in Domain Theory

This bibliography includes the seminal works by Dana Scott and his collaborators that established domain theory as a field.

## Key Papers and Works

*   **Scott, D. S. (1970). *Outline of a mathematical theory of computation*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This is one of the earliest and most influential papers where Scott lays out the foundational ideas for a mathematical theory of computation based on the notion of continuous lattices. It was a precursor to the full development of domain theory.

*   **Scott, D. S. (1972). *Continuous Lattices*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This paper, along with others from the same period, formally introduced the concept of continuous lattices and other key structures that form the basis of domain theory. It provided the mathematical tools needed to construct models of the lambda calculus.

*   **Scott, D. S. (1976). *Data types as lattices*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This paper shows how to represent data types as lattices, providing a clear and elegant denotational semantics for a variety of programming language constructs, including recursive types.

*   **Scott, D. S. & Strachey, C. (1971). *Toward a mathematical semantics for computer languages*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This influential paper, written with Christopher Strachey, motivated and outlined the approach of denotational semantics, where the meaning of a program is given by a mathematical object in a domain. This work set the agenda for much of the research in semantics for the following decades.

*   **Gierz, G., Hofmann, K. H., Keimel, K., Lawson, J. D., Mislove, M., & Scott, D. S. (2003). *Continuous Lattices and Domains*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This book is the comprehensive and standard reference for domain theory, covering all the major theoretical developments in the field. It is an indispensable resource for anyone doing serious research in this area.

*   **Abramsky, S., & Jung, A. (1994). *Domain theory*. In *Handbook of Logic in Computer Science*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This handbook chapter provides a thorough and accessible overview of domain theory and its applications in computer science. It is an excellent starting point for graduate students and researchers.
