# Foundational Papers and Books on Homotopy Type Theory

This bibliography lists the key works that established Homotopy Type Theory as a new field of mathematics.


The Book

*   **The Univalent Foundations Program (2013). *Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This book, often referred to as **"The HoTT Book"**, is the foundational text and comprehensive reference for the field. It was written collaboratively by a large group of researchers and provides a complete introduction to HoTT and the Univalent Foundations program. It is freely available online.


Key Papers

*   **Voevodsky, V. (2010). *The Equivalence Axiom and Univalent Models of Type Theory*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This paper, along with other talks and notes by Voevodsky, introduced the **Univalence Axiom**, a central and powerful axiom that equates isomorphism with identity. This was a key conceptual breakthrough that led to the development of HoTT.

*   **Awodey, S., & Warren, M. (2009). *Homotopy theoretic models of identity types*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This paper, along with Warren's PhD thesis, was one of the first to explicitly explore the connection between the identity types of Martin-Löf type theory and the path spaces of homotopy theory. Steve Awodey is credited with coining the term "Homotopy Type Theory".

*   **Hofmann, M., & Streicher, T. (1998). *The groupoid interpretation of type theory*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This paper provided a crucial early insight by showing that type theory could be modeled in the category of groupoids. This was a precursor to the more general idea of interpreting types as spaces and was an important step towards HoTT.

*   **Shulman, M., Lumsdaine, P. L., & Bauer, A. (2011). *Higher Inductive Types: A tour of the menagerie*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This paper (and related work by the authors) introduced **Higher Inductive Types (HITs)**, a powerful mechanism for defining types that have a specified topological shape. HITs are, along with the Univalence Axiom, a key ingredient of HoTT.
