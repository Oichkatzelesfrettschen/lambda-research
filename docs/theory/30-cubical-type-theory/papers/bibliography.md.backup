# Foundational Papers on Cubical Type Theory

This bibliography lists key papers that introduced and developed Cubical Type Theory, focusing on its constructive approach to univalent foundations.


Key Papers

*   **Cohen, C., Coquand, T., Huber, S., & Mörtberg, A. (2018). *Cubical Type Theory: A constructive interpretation of the univalence axiom*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This paper is a landmark in the field, providing a comprehensive and constructive interpretation of the Univalence Axiom within a cubical type theory. It laid the groundwork for practical implementations of univalent mathematics.

*   **Huber, S. (2016). *A constructive model of the univalence axiom*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This work, often cited as a precursor to the more complete formulation, presented an early constructive model of the Univalence Axiom, demonstrating its feasibility within a cubical framework.

*   **Coquand, T., & Mörtberg, A. (2015). *Cubical Type Theory*.**
    *   **Contribution:** An earlier presentation of the ideas behind Cubical Type Theory, focusing on the basic definitions of cubes, paths, and connections, and how they can be used to model identity types constructively.

*   **Awodey, S., Coquand, T., & van den Berg, B. (2015). *Homotopy Type Theory and Cubical Sets*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This paper explores the connection between Homotopy Type Theory and cubical sets, providing a categorical perspective on the models of cubical type theory.

*   **Mörtberg, A., & Nordvall Forsberg, F. (2018). *Cubical Agda: A dependently typed programming language with univalence and higher inductive types*.**
    *   **Contribution:** This paper describes **Cubical Agda**, a proof assistant that implements Cubical Type Theory, making univalent mathematics and higher inductive types computationally accessible to users.
