# Introduction to Lambda Calculus Research

Welcome to the Lambda Calculus Research Repository. This project serves as a comprehensive knowledge base and experimental platform for theoretical computer science.

## Overview

This repository is organized into several key areas:

*   **Fundamentals**: The starting point for those new to the field.
*   **Foundation**: Core lambda calculus variants and type theories.
*   **Type Systems**: Advanced extensions and specialized type theories.
*   **Advanced Variants**: Cutting-edge research topics.
*   **Theory**: Theoretical foundations and mathematical models.
*   **Practice**: Real-world implementations and proof assistants.

## Navigating the Repository

Use the sidebar to explore the different categories. Each topic includes foundational papers, historical context, and implementation details.

## Experimental Suite

We have recently integrated a high-performance experimental suite, **Unified Spandrel Synthesis (USS)**, focused on neuro-symbolic program synthesis using SM89-optimized CUDA kernels.
