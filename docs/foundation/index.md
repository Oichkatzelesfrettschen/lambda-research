# Foundation

Core lambda calculus systems that form the theoretical foundation of type theory and functional programming.

## Lambda Cube

The foundation section covers the fundamental systems of the lambda cube:

- **Simply Typed Lambda Calculus** - Basic type safety
- **System F** - Parametric polymorphism
- **System F<sub>ω</sub>** - Higher-kinded types
- **Calculus of Constructions** - Dependent types and higher-order logic

## Historical Development

These systems represent the historical development and theoretical foundation upon which all modern type systems are built.
