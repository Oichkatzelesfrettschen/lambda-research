## About This Resource

This site grew out of frustration with lambda calculus resources that either:
- Promise comprehensive coverage but deliver broken links
- Assume too much background knowledge
- Focus on citations instead of actual reading

We believe in **quality over quantity** and **accessibility over comprehensiveness**.

## Mathematical Notation

This documentation supports comprehensive mathematical notation. For example:

$$\lambda x. x \quad \text{(identity function)}$$

$$\frac{\Gamma \vdash M : \sigma \to \tau \quad \Gamma \vdash N : \sigma}{\Gamma \vdash M N : \tau} \text{(application rule)}$$
