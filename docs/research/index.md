## How to Use This Library

### [SEARCH] If You're Looking for a Specific Paper
1. **Try the [Comprehensive Index](COMPREHENSIVE_INDEX.md)** first
2. **Search by author, year, or keyword**
3. **Check access status** (Open Access, DOI, institutional)
4. **Use fallback sources** if primary links are broken

### [EXPLORE] If You're Exploring a Topic
1. **Start with [Cross-References](CROSS_REFERENCE_SYSTEM.md)** to understand context
2. **Find related systems** that might have better paper coverage
3. **Check [Implementation Catalog](lambda-calculus-implementations-catalog.md)** for working examples
4. **Return to fundamentals** if papers seem too advanced

### [RESEARCH] If You're Doing Research
1. **Use this as a starting point**, not a complete database
2. **Follow citation chains** from papers you can access
3. **Check recent arXiv papers** for cutting-edge work
4. **Contact authors directly** for papers behind paywalls
